## Available Sites
### Paper Boy
The first site available is this one page portfolio site named *Paper Boy*. It will consists of About, Work and Contact sections.

### Red Rover
The second site available is a business website, and also a one page site. Featuring a simple color scheme of grey and off-white with a splash of red, *Red Rover* contains About, Pricing and Contact sections.

### Blog.com
  Like *Red Rover*, *Blog.com* is a business website. It has a white and salmon color scheme, and is intended to sell a blog creation and hosting service. It consists of About, Pricing and Contact sections.
  
### Code Cafe
  *Code Cafe* is one of my favorites. It advertises a service, which I eventually decided was an open-source program for coders. When it is complete, it will be the first two page site, with a help page, and include about and download sections on the home page.
